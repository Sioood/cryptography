# Cryptography

This is a project to encrypt and decrypt text with a key.

The key can be anything, a password, a passphrase...
Any string with no restriction if not your own mind.

You can encrypt multiple time a text, like setup multiple password to an account.

The key is the private thing of this system and the text is public. You can share the text with almost 100% confidence.
It's like a lock and the key. Anyone can see the lock but anyone cannot open it. Have this public is not a security fail or a danger.
